# TQS Project
Application developed as the group final project required for TQS

## Project Abstract
The aim of this project is to create both a delivery engine that can be reused by multiple services, as well as develope a service to demonstrate the usage of the aforementioned. Furthermore it should also contain a wide range of unit and integration tests, as well as static cde analysis and CI/CD pipeline.

The engine can be considered a digital marketplace for “last-mile” deliveries, and offers services such as rider's dispacth, manage a dynamic workforce of riders and order tracking. The main goal is to facilitate the delivery of goods to third-party services that can be registered in the app, which also includes reputation management and a performance dashboard acessible through an API or a website.

The example service, Book2Door, implements this engine using it to make deliveries of books to their clients (where books are picked up by the workforce of riders in the respective book store and delivered to the specified location).
